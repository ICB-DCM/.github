## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub organization of the [Hasenauer Lab](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/research/hasenauer-group) at University of Bonn, Germany.

For our research in computational biology, we developed a number of tools, mostly around simulation of dynamical models and parameter inference.

The highlights are:

* [pypesto](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO/) for parameter estimation in Python
* [PEtab](https://petab.readthedocs.io/) for specifying parameter estimation problems in systems biology in an efficient and interoperable manner
* [AMICI](https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI/) for scalable simulation and sensitivity analysis (Python / C++ (/ Matlab))
* [pyABC](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyABC) for distributed and scalable ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) for parameter estimation of complex stochastic models (Python)
